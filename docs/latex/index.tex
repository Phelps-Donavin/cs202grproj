{\itshape Issues\+:} \mbox{\hyperlink{classEcho}{Echo}} fails when delay is larger than the total number of sample sizes since the extended vector will try to access a -\/1 element of a vector which doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist.

{\itshape Challenges\+:} This was the first time all of us had dealt with any form of Binary data, in addition to this this was the first time all of us dealt with audio files in any form. As such, much of this project was spent researching how Binary data and Audio data work independently and cooperatively. Once the elements of both were understood the project went rather smoothly.

{\itshape Build}\+: Run \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} in the Linux Terminal. Use ./audio\+\_\+processor Audio is provided in the Test Sounds Directory, before running make sure any audio you want to use is in the same directory as audio\+\_\+processor.
